# FractalGeneratorPy
An example of a Fractal Generator Interface using Python Turtle and Tkinter 

Download Python 3, and run the the module "FractalsInterface.py" in IDLE. This script references the custom turtle fractal figures from "turtlefigures.py". 

Choose your preferred fractals to draw, colours, sizes, and recursiveness. Or choose random!

# Knows issues: 

Stay between 50-150 size for fractals, otherwise it draws beyond the boundary.  

Before Clearing, let the fractal finish drawing; otherwise, it clears the previously drawn lines and continues with the rest. 

# Enjoy the Fractal Generator!
